### Compatible PocketMine-MP Versions: 3.X.X
Currently being revived by 95CivicSi - Stay tuned for more updates

PureEntitiesX is currently in development while PocketMine-MP works towards reaching a stable API version.  This means that there is no stable release of PureEntitesX and changes are being made very frequently.  Please bear with us as we work towards a complete MobAI solution.  The most reliable versions of PureEntitiesX will be released to Poggit (https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PureEntitiesX/).  Released versions will be updated to work with released versions of PocketMine-MP (found here: https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/releases).  This means that if you are using the latest build of PocketMine-MP from jenkins.pmmp.io or directly from the PocketMine-MP master branch, then PureEntitiesX may not work as those versions are constantly being changed and updated with new items daily (sometimes multiple times per day).
